/**
 * ======================================================================
 * File: hooks/frontendHooks/useCompanySelection.ts
 * Project: DriveDock (SSP Truck Line) â€“ Driver Onboarding
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Purpose:
 *   Centralized store for the currently selected company in the onboarding
 *   flow. This selection is reused across prequalification and subsequent
 *   steps (e.g., for country-specific logic, application type, branding).
 *
 * Why Zustand + Persist?
 *   - Zustand keeps the API tiny and ergonomic for React components.
 *   - The persist middleware stores the selection in localStorage so the
 *     choice survives tab refreshes (very common for drivers).
 *
 * Contract / Data Model:
 *   - `CompanyData` extends the static `Company` definition and optionally
 *     includes an `ECompanyApplicationType` (e.g., "Flatbed", "Dry Van").
 *   - `selectedCompany` is `null` until a user picks a company on entry.
 *
 * SSR Note:
 *   - This hook is client-side only (uses localStorage via persist).
 *   - Do not import this file in Next.js server components or API routes.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const { selectedCompany, setSelectedCompany, clearSelectedCompany } =
 *     useCompanySelection();
 *
 *   setSelectedCompany({ ...company, type: ECompanyApplicationType.FLATBED });
 *   // ...later
 *   clearSelectedCompany();
 *
 * Persistence:
 *   - Stored under localStorage key: "drivedock-selected-company"
 *   - IMPORTANT: On successful POST of page-1 (creating tracker), this
 *     store is typically left intact (it represents the company context),
 *     whereas prequalification answers are cleared.
 *
 * Single Source of Truth:
 *   - `ECompanyApplicationType` is declared here. If you need to share this
 *     enum with server code, move it to a shared non-React module (e.g.,
 *     "@/types/company.types") and import it here, rather than the other way.
