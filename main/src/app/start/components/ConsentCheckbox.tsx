/**
 * Consent Checkbox Component â€” DriveDock
 *
 * Description:
 * This component is used to capture the user's agreement to the terms and conditions
 * before they can proceed in the onboarding process. Instead of checking the box directly,
 * clicking on it opens a `TermsModal` where the user can read and agree to the terms.
 *
 * Key Components & Hooks:
 * - `useMounted`: Prevents hydration mismatches by rendering only after client mount.
 * - `TermsModal`: Modal displaying the terms and conditions with Agree/Cancel options.
 * - `useTranslation`: Provides multilingual label text from `common.json`.
 *
 * Props:
 * - `agreed` (boolean): Whether the user has already agreed to the terms.
 * - `setAgreed` (function): Setter to update the `agreed` state in the parent component.
 *
 * Functionality:
 * - If the user has not yet agreed, clicking the checkbox or label opens the `TermsModal`.
 * - The modal contains an Agree button which sets `agreed` to true and closes the modal.
 * - Prevents direct manual checking of the box without modal confirmation.
 *
 * Routing:
 * This component is typically used on onboarding start pages (e.g., `/start`) before allowing progression.
